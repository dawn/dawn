## **Note that this project is discontinued in favour of us joining efforts with [Flynn](https://github.com/flynn/flynn). No future work is planned on this as the artchitecture is fundamentally flawed. We suggest you rather check out [Flynn](http://flynn.io) instead.**

Hello, welcome to Dawn, a PaaS that leverages Ruby on Rails and Docker. It implements a Heroku-like interface,
with an API-first approach. Initial development started in October 2013 intending to be launched as a commercial
service eventually, however due to the increasing competition in the PaaS market, and the lack of time, we've
released it as open-source. Enjoy!

Our current development stack is ubuntu 14.04, running docker, ruby 2.1.2 (rails 4.1.1), postgresql, redis, logplex and hipache.


## Features

* Releasing apps onto the platform via git
* Building app containers via Buildstep
* Importing ENV variables into the app space
* Retrieving app logs, and setting up drain urls, to which logs can be submitted via HTTP POST
* Scaling per-proctype

## Prerequisites
* A system capable of running amd64 VMs (for our development box)
* Vagrant >= 1.6.2
* Patience (if you have a bad network connection and/or not so fancy computer)

## Installation (Development)

### dnsmasq
The box IP needs to resolve to dawn.dev and dawnapp.dev (configurable in config/application.yml). You can add an alias to
/etc/resolv.conf, or use your own method of doing so. We suggest using dnsmasq, with the following line
in it's configuration:

```
# /etc/dnsmasq.conf
...
address=/dev/192.168.33.10
```

### The machine

Setting up a development environment is pretty easy. All it takes to get the box up and running is:

```shell
$ vagrant up
```

The initial provisioning run might take a while, because we pull and build several dependencies.

All set! Your box is now ready to use.

```
curl http://api.dawn.dev/healthcheck
```

In order to provision a custom server, you can use the included script,
`script/provision`. Another option is to copy Dawn onto the server, and run the
steps yourself; `script/setup && script/build && script/bootstrap` (in fact, `script/provision` is a wrapper
that does exactly that).

```
script/provision root@myserver.com
```

[Our client](https://github.com/dawn/dawn-cli) is recommended currently, as it's the most feature complete, however, a
web interface is also in the works, available under [dashboard.dawn.dev](http://dashboard.dawn.dev).

### Using the CLI utility

The client can be easily installed via Rubygems.

```
$ gem install dawn-cli
```

A list of all available commands along with descriptions is available under `dawn help`.

Workflow usually looks like this: First we log into our Dawn account.

```
$ dawn login
Username: Speed
Password: test1234
```

The utility then stores the API token under `~/.netrc` for further use.

Next up, we need to add our ssh key, in order to be authorized to push to the platform. This will automatically take your

```
dawn key add
```

Then, we initialize our project on the Dawn platform.

```
$ cd awesome-app
$ dawn create
```

And we're done! To build our app, simply push to the `dawn` remote.

```
$ git push dawn master

## Proposed features

* [ ] dawn run: one-off containers running a single command then getting destroyed
* [ ] Adding custom domains
* [ ] Services: db, queues, caches, mail servers, file storage
* [ ] Rollback to a specific release
* [X] Inject the ENV config into the releases
* [ ] Resource limiting: constraints on CPU, memory, bandwidth, disk space...
* [ ] Per app metrics
* [ ] Global server metrics, so we can monitor the entire server
* [ ] Monitoring: restart any crashed gear
* [ ] Manage different release environments

* [ ] Use a grsecurity patched kernel (or coreOS)

* [ ] Use OAuth2 to make a provider for token generation, authentication and authorization
  * https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/oauth

* [ ] Logging: allow us to specify drains (uses logplex drains to post logs to a drain)

## FAQ
### vagrant provision stalls at dawn/buildstep
Buildstep takes quite a bit to build, in the case that it shows no sign of
movement, you can also try to build it manually:
```shell
dawn$ vagrant ssh
vagrant@ubuntu-14:~$ cd /app
vagrant@ubuntu-14:/app$ docker build -t dawn/buildstep .
```

### bundle install fails in a SSL error
Try running the provisioning again, it's probably a network error.

### API is not working after a VM reboot
This is because we're still using the foreman generated upstart files, that don't watch for vagrant-mounted event. This will be resolved in the near future, but for now, ssh into the box and restart the service. It should take about 30-60 seconds to restart.

```
vagrant ssh
vagrant@ubuntu-14:~$ sudo restart dawn
```

### API is not working after a system sleep/hybernation
Vagrant sometimes seems to unmount the shared folder `/app` on such occasions. Run `vagrant reload`.

## Documentation
[API documentation](http://dawn.github.io/docs/) is available. We're in the process of providing online CLI documentation and guides as well.
